# Ensemble-Methods-in-Python
This homework introduces ensemble methods such as bagging, random forest, boosting, and voting. I constructed classifiers using each method to predict whether an instance of breast cancer was malignant or benign based on various feature values. Once all the classifiers were built, I compared their accuracies and identified the classifier with the highest accuracy.
